            <mark>The case was filed “individually and on behalf of a class of similarly situated individuals.”8</mark> The plaintiffs alleged that Philip Morris violated the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Business Practices Act and the Uniform Deceptive Trade Policies Act. They also “alleged that the defendant’s light cigarettes did not contain significantly less tar and nicotine than regular cigarettes, as they claimed. Any person buying light cigarettes did not get what the defendants advertised. The defendant intentionally manipulated the design of the cigarettes to maximize nicotine delivery while at the same time produce lower machine-measured levels of tar and nicotine.”9

            <u>On February 1, 2001, Judge Nicholas G. Byron certified the class action lawsuit. The class was officially defined as “all persons who purchased Defendant’s Cambridge Lights and Marlboro Lights cigarettes in Illinois for personal consumption, between the first date the Defendant placed its Cambridge Lights and Marlboro Lights cigarettes into the stream of commerce through—February 8, 2001.”10</u>
            The trial began on January 21, 2003 and lasted until March 6, 2003. The case was renamed Price v. Philip Morris on February 11, 2003 when the plaintiffs were granted their motion for withdrawal of two of the four named plaintiffs.11 Sharon Price and Michael Fruth remained as the representative plaintiffs.

            <i>On March 21, 2003, Judge Nicholas G. Byron entered a judgement against Philip Morris in a bench trial.<i> His ruling said that Philip Morris misled customers into believing they were buying a safer cigarette.12 He awarded the plaintiffs $7.1005 billion in compensatory damages and $3 billion in punitive damages to be paid to the state of Illinois for a total of $10.1 billion.13 In addition, he awarded attorney fees in the amount of 25% of the compensatory award.
            <br>
            Philip Morris was required to put up $12 billion before they could appeal the case to cover the $10.1 billion judgement. Philip Morris asked for a reduction in this appeal bond and on April 14, 2003 Judge Byron lowered it to $6.8 billion. On July 14, 2003, the Illinois 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Judge Byron lacked the authority to reduce it and the bond must remain at $12 billion.14 Philip Morris argued that they could not post the $12 billion dollar bond because it would force them into bankruptcy and threaten their ability to pay other tobacco case settlements.15 Philip Morris appealed the $12 billion decision to the Illinois Supreme Court and on September 17, 2003 the bond was reduced back down to $6.8 billion.16 The appeal bond was placed in an escrow account in the form of a $6 billion promissory note and maintained by the Madison County Circuit Clerk.17 Interest payments were made to the account every six months, plus Philip Morris was required to deposit $800 million in cash to the account which were paid in four quarterly payments. All interest earned on the money placed in this escrow account would remain with Madison County, despite the outcome of the case.        </p>
