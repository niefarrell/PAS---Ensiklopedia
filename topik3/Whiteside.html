            <mark>William Bolin Whiteside (1777–1833) </mark>and his family were among the first Anglo-Americans to settle Illinois. He played a critical role in transforming an Indian and French landscape to the 21st state to join the union, fighting Indians in many wars including the War of 1812. Today he is buried on the campus of SIUE.
            <br>
            <u>Whiteside was born in the backwoods of North Carolina in the third year of the American Revolution, December 27, 1777.1 In 1780, </u>his father and uncles were among the 900 backwoods patriots who defeated British Loyalists in the Battle of King’s Mountain, the first decisive American victory in the southern colonies.2 In 1793 the large Whiteside family migrated to the nascent American territory in Illinois when William Bolin was 15.3
            Settling in southwestern Illinois, they found less than a thousand Anglo-Americans scattered in various forts, towns, and farms in the American Bottom across the Mississippi River from the Spanish-owned, French trading post of St. Louis. The French population was nearly twice as large in the American Bottom, and the remnants of the once-mighty Illinois Confederacy of American Indian tribes also lived near the French towns.4 Other Indian groups, such as the Kickapoo and Potawatomi, recognized the serious threat American settlers like the Whitesides posed to their way of life. They raided Anglo-American settlements, killed unsuspecting settlers, and stole horses.5
            <br>
            <i>The Whitesides began the process of “taming the wilderness” as soon as they arrived. William Bolin’s father, also named William Whiteside, reclaimed an abandoned fort originally built by the Flannery family. </i>They had abandoned the fort after James Flannery was shot and scalped by attacking Indians in 1783. Exactly a decade later, the Whitesides brought new life to the fort and it came to be known as Whiteside Station, located in what is now Monroe County.6 It was one of a number of stations or forts built in the American Bottom for defense against Indian attacks.
            
            Whites also conducted raiding parties of their own. In 1793 William Bolin’s father, uncle, and cousin pursued and attacked a group of Kickapoo that had stolen horses. They killed at least one of the Kickapoo. A year later, the father of the slain Kickapoo killed William Bolin’s 14-year-old brother Thomas as he was playing outside Whiteside Station.7 In 1795, William Bolin likely fought against Indians for the first time in the Battle of Canteen Creek, though it is probably best described as a slaughter. Fourteen Americans, including many Whitesides, attacked an Osage camp near modern-day Caseyville, and, if later accounts are accurate, killed every man, woman, and child. Their bodies were left to lay where they died; leaving their skeletons behind for many years as a warning to Indians.8
            That same year, 1795, William Bolin and his brother Uel became acquainted with the daughters of Elizabeth Raines, an Anglo widow living in the largely French settlement of Cahokia. William Bolin and Sarah were married shortly thereafter, as were Uel and Ann.9 Their first daughter was born in 1799.10        </p>
