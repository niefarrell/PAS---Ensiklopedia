            <mark>Paul Simon </mark>was an Illinois Democratic senator from Madison County born November 19, 1928 to a devout Lutheran family in Eugene, Oregon.1 Despite never completing college, he became a successful businessman, senator, and advocate for human rights who fought against corruption at the local, state and national levels.

            <br>
            <u>During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Simon’s father Martin worked as a pastor while his mother Ruth worked at a local cannery.2 </u>While living in Oregon, his father built a publishing and editing company he operated out of their garage with equipment purchased with a loan.3 Simon attended Eugene High School where he came to the realization that he did not want to enter the religious vocation as previously planned and had several teachers who encouraged him to pursue journalism.4 After graduating, he worked part-time writing sports columns for the Eugene Register-Guard.5 He attended the University of Oregon starting at age 16, and after his family moved to Highland, Illinois, he transferred to Dana College in Blair, Nebraska.6
            <br>
            <i>During his junior year at Dana College, Simon’s father wrote to him informing him of a business and job opportunity at a weekly paper, the Troy Call, located in Troy, Illinois. </i>Simon left college and purchased the paper in 1948 for $3,600, almost entirely funded by the local Troy Security Bank run by James Watson.7 With the aid of his family, especially his mother and brother, Simon launched the newly named Troy Tribune as a four-page weekly on June 24, 1948.8        </p>
